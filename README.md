# Bike-Buyers-Analysis-Dashboard-Excel

### Project Overview

This project analyzes customer demographic and socioeconomic data to understand factors influencing bike purchase decisions. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and transformed raw customer data, created pivot tables for aggregation, and built an interactive dashboard to uncover patterns across income, age, commute distance, and region.

The goal was to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis: from raw data preparation to insight-driven visualization that supports business decision-making.

### Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning & transformation

Derived variables (Age Brackets)

Pivot Tables

Interactive Dashboard & Charts

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard focuses on the following KPIs:

1.Bike Purchase Rate (%)

Percentage of customers who purchased a bike

2.Bike Purchases by Age Group

Distribution of purchases across age brackets

3.Bike Purchases by Income Level

Comparison of purchasing behavior across income categories

4.Bike Purchases by Commute Distance

Relationship between commuting distance and likelihood of purchase

5.Bike Purchases by Region

Regional differences in bike adoption

6.Average Income of Bike Buyers vs Non-Buyers

Economic comparison between the two groups

### Dashboard Insights

Middle-aged customers show the highest likelihood of purchasing bikes compared to younger and older age groups.

Customers with moderate incomes are more likely to purchase bikes than very low- or very high-income earners.

Bike purchases are highest among individuals with short to medium commute distances, suggesting bikes are primarily used for daily commuting rather than long travel.

Certain regions consistently outperform others in bike purchases, indicating geographic influence on consumer behavior.

### Key Business Insight

Customers with moderate income levels and shorter commute distances represent the highest-value target segment for bike sales.

This insight suggests that marketing strategies should focus on:

Urban and suburban commuters

Customers seeking cost-effective and practical transportation

Regions with high short-distance commuting patterns

Targeting this segment could significantly increase conversion rates while minimizing marketing costs.
